> Total ( 14 marks) 

*Complete the Lab and export as a python notebook and submit to d2l.*

1. Upload the file movies.json to databricks. This will place the file in DBFS. We can then load the file into a dataframe.
2. Create a new databricks notebook.
3. Load the movies.json file from DBFS into a dataframe and display the first 10 records and print the schema for the dataframe. ( 2 marks)
4. Use the ‘withColumn’ command to add a new column ‘decade’. Store
the result in a new dataframe and print the first 10 movies to verify the column was added. ( 2 marks)
5. Use the ‘withColumnRenamed’ command to rename the first two columns to ‘actor’ and ‘title’. Store the result in a new dataframe and print the first 10 movies to verify the columns were renamed. (2 marks)
6. Use the DataFrame api to determine which decade has the most number of movies. ( 4 marks)
7. Compute the number of movies each actor was in. The output should have two columns: actor, count. The output should be ordered by the count in descending order. ( 4 marks)
