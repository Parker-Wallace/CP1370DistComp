# Lab #6 Spark Dataframes and Spark SQL ( 25 marks) 
> Due Monday Feb 23rd

(We will be using Databricks community edition for this lab)

Export as an IPython notebook and submit to the dropbox

1. Load the flight-summary.csv into a dataframe: ( be sure to use the correct path )

```
flight_summary = spark.read \
.format("csv") \
.option("header", "true") \
.option("inferSchema", "true") \
.load("<replace-with-path>/flight-summary.csv")
```

This data represents the number of flights taking place from origin airports to destination airports.

2. Write a query which determines how many unique origin airports are contained in the
data. ( 3 marks)
3. Modify query #2 to use the approx._count_distinct function with a margin of error of
10%. (3 marks) Why does this function exists as it is not completely accurate? ( 2
marks)
4. What does the function skewness determine? (2 marks) Write a query which outputs
the skewness of the “count” column. (3 marks) What does the result indicate? ( 2 marks
)
5. Write a query which outputs the top 5 most popular destination cities. You will need to
group the data by destination state and destination city. ( 5 marks )
6. Write a query which groups the data by each origin airport and outputs the sum,
average and standard deviation of the count column. Use the “.agg” function ( 5 marks )
