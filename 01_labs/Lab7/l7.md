# Lab 7  Additional Spark SQL and Dataframe techniques (Total 20 marks)
> Due Friday Feb 28th

1.	(5 marks)The file mpg.csv contains data about various automobiles
Load this file into a dataframe.  Group by the manufacturer and use a collection method to add a column which shows all unique models that manufacturer has.

2.	(5 marks) For the dataframe loaded from the mpg.csv file, generate a dataframe which is grouped by the year and cylinder (cyl) columns.  Use the pivot method to add columns for the average city mpg(cty) for each manufacturer.  Round the average city mpg to 1 decimal place to make the output easier to read.

3.	(5 marks) The file flight-summary.csv contains information about flights between various locations.   The file airports.csv contains additional information about each airport, some of which is not in the flight-summary.csv file.  

Create a dataframe which contains the origin_code, origin_airport, latitude (for origin airport), longitude (for origin airport), dest_code, dest_airport, latitude (for destination airport), longitude (for destination airport) for every flight which originates in the state of Texas (TX).  

Which type of join technique ( Shuffle or Broadcast) did Spark likely use for this exercise?  Why?

4.	(5 marks) The file aapl-2017.csv contains information about daily apple stock prices.  Calculate the weekly average price using a window function inside the groupBy transformation.  Order the result by the start time.
